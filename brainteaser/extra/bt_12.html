			<p>On the first weighing, you would weigh three weights on each side. Either one side of the scales will be lighter or else they are the same weight, thus the group with the lighter weight can be identified. Then you would place one weight on each side of scale, and leave one off.  This method will identify the light weight while only performing two weightings in total.</p>
